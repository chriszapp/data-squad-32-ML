    "Linear models make assumptions about the features, the labels and the relations between them.\n",

    "The first is that the features are assumed to be error-free. This is not the case, as data is a combination of signal (error-free information) plus noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "In linear models, the labels are also asumed to be the result of a linear combination of the features, using coefficients that are optimised by the loss function. This is not as much of an issue as the first assumption since the model can be adjusted to fit a polynomial function.\n",
    "\n",
    "With function approximations, the domain of the train/test variables plays an important part. The model might produce very close approximations/predictions of the label close to that domain, but the more distant it gets the more it will start to diverge. This is another assumption made by linear models: that errors will be evenly distributed across the regression line."

    "The simplest solution would be to get more data so that the model can analyse a broader range of possible inputs. This additional data can be entirely new (which is preferable) or derived from the existing one (like manipulating existing images to train computer vision models, but this is not the preferable solution as it can be argued that the manipulated data is still the same data and so would not solve the overfitting problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "If more data is unavailable, another option is to reduce the number of features or check if it is possible to perform dimensionality reduction. Some features might be strongly correlated with each other, and so their presence might be unnecessarily increasing the complexity of the model. Reducing the dimensionality of the data would be another way to reduce the model complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different models might also be better at handling the available data and have a greater tolerance towards overfitting, so it could be interesting to compare their performance with that of the original model to see if overfitting remains an issue.\n",

    "I might also attempt to apply smoothing techniques or regularization to the data available and compare the model's performance to see if that decreases overfitting."

    "The Naive Bayes algorithm is used for classification problems and it is based on the Bayes Theorem for calculating probabilities and conditional probabilities. One important assumption that it makes is that the variables are independent. It is a simple model that requires relatively low computational power, so it performs well on large data sets in comparison with other, more complex, models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes Theorem states that `P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)` so the first step to implement this algorithm is to extract the prior probability P(B|A) from the data. We then write the contingency table that represents the data to find the marginal probabilities P(A) and P(B). After that, we can use Bayes Theorem to calculate the class with the highest posterior probability P(A|B) and therefore the outcome of the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the problems of this algorithm is that it needs the variables to be independent to work well, which might be difficult to find in the real world. Another drawback is the \"Zero Frequency\" problem: if a variable in the test set has a value that was not observed in the training set, then the model might assign it a probability of zero and will be unable to make a prediction."
