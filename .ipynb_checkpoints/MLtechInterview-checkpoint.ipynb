    "There isn't a correct solution to this challenge. All we would like to learn is your thinking process that demonstrates your knowledge, experience, and creativity in developing machine learning models. Therefore, in addition to developing the model and optimizing its performance, you should also elaborate your thinking process and justify your decisions thoughout the iterative problem-solving process.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Download the housing prices data set (housing_prices.csv). The data is big enough to showcase your thoughts but not so that processing power will be a problem.\n",
    "- Using Python, analyze the features and determine which feature set to select for modeling.\n",
    "- Train and cross validate several regression models, attempting to accurately predict the SalePrice target variable.\n",
    "- Evaluate all models and show comparison of performance metrics.\n",
    "- State your thoughts on model performance, which model(s) you would select, and why.\n",

    "- Your thinking process.\n",
