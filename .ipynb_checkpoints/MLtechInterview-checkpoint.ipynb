    "Most machine learning models (except Decision Trees and Random Forest) have a series of assumptions that are common between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linear relationship:** linear and logistic regression models need the relationship between the independent and dependent variables to be linear. The best way to check this is with scatter plots. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multivariate normality:** a specific requirement of the linear regression is multivariate normality. Goodness-of-fit tests (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) can be used to confirm normality. And log-transformation sometimes help when the data is not normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multicollinearity:** most models also assume that there is no multicollinearity in the data (when features are highly correlated with each other). Because correlated variables add vewry little information to a model, the common solution is to remove them (after identifying using a correlation matrix).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Autocorrelation:** this problem occurs when the residuals are not independent from each other (for example in a time series). The Durbin-Watson test can be used to detect autocorrelation in the residuals of a correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Homoscedasticity:** much like parametric hypothesis tests, linear regression require homoscedasticity (equal variances across the features).\n",
    "\n",
    "Other examples of assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Different models have different requirements. For example, time series models (such as ARIMA) assume stationarity: a process where the mean, variance and autocorrelation structure do not change over time. Another example is the K-means clustering, which assumes that clusters are spherical and of equal size between each other.\n",

    "The KNN as a supervised method requires labeled data to train on. New and unlabeled data is then classified by majority rule of the **k** number of nearest data points. On the other hand, K-means clustering aims to partition data points into **k** clusters. Starting from a random points, K-means iteratively calculates the distance of a point to every other point and updates the mean of each cluster. "

    "Overfitting is the production of a model that corresponds too closely to a particular set of data, and may therefore fail to predict additional data. This usually occurs when a model has too many features for the amount of data. Overfitting can be detected when our model does much better on the training set than on the test set. There are several ways to address overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature selection**: simply dropping columns. \n",
    "- **Dimensionality reduction:** techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduce the dimensions of your feature space, hence you have fewer relationships between variables to consider and you are less likely to overfit your model.\n",
    "- **More data points**\n",
    "- **Cross validation:** not really a solution but more of a prevention measure, like washing our hands. \n",
    "- **Regularization:** these are techniques that attempt to simplify the model such as adding penalties to the cost function, but I admit I don't entirely understand how it works.\n"
